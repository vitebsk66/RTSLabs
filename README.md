Sample code and reponses for review by RTS Labs.

1. See 'aboveBelow.php'.
2. See 'charRotate.php'.
3. My only real problem, if you can call it that, with PHP is some inconsistency in syntax. One specific example is in the case of the implode and explode commands. These are complementary commands that essentially do the reverse of each other. The problem was that the order of parameters each expects was reversed, which made no sense. Thankfully, this has been addressed in the latest incarnation of the language (PHP 8).
